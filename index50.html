                        <p>Neymar's common exemplary traits are his creativity, passing, clinical
                            finishing, exceptional
                            dribbling and technical ability, being described as both "electric" and "explosive"</p>

                        <P>Perhaps more than any other of his numerous qualities, Messi is unique
                            for his blend of
                            intelligence and perceptiveness as both a creator and scorer of goals. The little
                            Argentine's decision-making between passing and shooting is especially clear in cases of
                            an
                            onrushing goalkeeper.</P>

                        <h3 class="player-name">Cristiano Ronaldo</h3>
                        <p>Directness of Dribbling / Play.If you've watched Ronaldo progress over
                            the years, you will
                            notice a dramatic difference in his play. Obsession with Goals.To say Ronaldo is
                            passionate
                            about his goals would be an understatement.</p>

                        <h3 class="player-name">Paulo Dybala</h3>
                        <p>"I think playing just off the centre-forward is the best position for Dybala, because he
                            can
                            assist dribble and score goals.</p>

                        <p>Ozil is the guy who picks the ball up in the final third after much of
                            the hard work is done
                            and then applies his magic. He is a supremely creative player and possesses great
                            composure
                            in pressurize situations in front of goal.</p>

                            competition. PSG have
                            got their hands on the potential heir to Edinson Cavani, in Icardi. PSG signing him on a
                            permanent basis will depend on many different things,” </p>

                            excellent dribbling

                        <p>From nothing he has become the talk of football, his hard work and
                            passion have taken him to
                            stratospheric heights in his career, his simplicity and humility have propelled his
                            popularity. Despite his fame, Salah is a philanthropist supporting development in his
                            country, uniting his people, the Muslim and the Arabs.</p>

                        <p>He is also a complete striker. He can score a good header, good with tap
                            ins and long shots.
                            He is pretty good with left foot and his accuracy. This makes him a complete striker.

                        <p>De Bruyne positions himself to provide an option for a backward pass from
                            an advanced
                            position on the right – at the maximum possible distance from his direct opponent – so
                            that
                            he can advance to meet a pass and deliver a first-time, whipped ball towards far-side
